# Haunter Jr

Haunter jr is a 2d singleplayer or multiplayer platformer/puzzle game where 2 individuals must escape from an elaborate mansion with the help of a pair of ghost brothers. In the game, players must complete puzzles by switching between 2 different characters by using a swap mechanic. Each character has unique qualities that make them necessary to solve particular puzzle components however only one character can be controlled at once (the other character is immobilized while the other is being "haunted" or controlled). The objective of the game is for the player or players who are playing as the ghost brothers to help guide the 2 characters out of the mansion by completing all the levels.

**Singleplayer vs multiplayer**

In multiplayer, every time the players use the swap mechanic the person piloting the character will swap (each player will have separate hotkeys example one wasd the other arrow keys.) While this is happening the other player can still interact with the game (gameplay tbd)

**Mechanics**
